* 1x Desktop Linux of your choice
* 4x Linux Servers


You will be given a total of 10 VLANs for your network; you may use fewer, but no more.


## Instructions:


This will just be an initial design, and you will be expected to amend it throughout the semester as you learn more about these systems. The focus is on creating a **robust foundational plan** that can evolve as the network grows.


You will need to create the needed tables, figures, diagrams, etc., to plan out and explain your design. This is **not a final draft**, and it will most likely change as you implement it over the semester, but it must be complete and include all the items below.


There will be **one deliverable** for this assignment: a written technical document outlining the **design requirements, network design (logical and physical), and software/technologies** you plan to use.


### Step 1: Technologies & Software


Choose the technologies & software that you will use. Several technologies you may want to consider include:


1. **Router** (OPNSense, PfSense, IPFire)
1. **Firewall** (IPFire, OpenWrt, OPNSense, PfSense)
1. **DNS** (BIND, Unbound, dnsmasq, PowerDNS)
1. **IDS/IPS/SIEM** (Security Onion, Gravwell, Splunk, ELK, Wazuh)
1. **Web Server** (Apache, Nginx)
1. **VPN** (OpenVPN, WireGuard, OPNSense)
1. **File Server** (Samba, OpenMediaVault, TrueNAS)
1. **Database** (MySQL, Postgres, MariaDB)
1. **Backup and Restore Solution** (Bacula, Duplicati, UrBackup)
1. **DHCP Server** (OPNSense, Windows Server)
1. **Metric Server** (Graphite, InfluxDB)


**Additional Considerations:**


- You may select alternative technologies if they better meet your objectives.
- For any new software/system added, document the justification and expected benefit.
- Include considerations for **ease of maintenance, security, scalability, and disaster recovery** in your selection rationale.


### Step 2: Network Diagram


1. Create **logical and physical network diagrams** that meet the above requirements (two separate diagrams).
1. Include **IP addresses** (use `10.0.0.0/8`), VLAN IDs (maximum 10), subnets, gateways, and network segments.
1. Include **server and workstation placement**, showing which VLAN each host belongs to.
1. Justify design decisions and state any assumptions clearly. For example:
  - VLAN segmentation for security (servers vs. workstations)
  - Redundant paths for critical systems
  - Choice of private IP ranges for internal communication


- Each team has **10 VLANs** to use. VLAN IDs, switch ports, and WAN IP ranges are assigned as follows:


| Team Number | VLAN Range| Switch Ports | VPN Port | WAN IP Range | Proxmox URL |
| -- | ------- | ----- | ---- | --------------------------| ------------------------- |
| 1  | 200-209 | 13-14 | 1347 | 172.16.40.10-172.16.40.11 | https://172.16.40.10:8006 |
| 2  | 210-219 | 15-16 | 1348 | 172.16.40.12-172.16.40.13 | https://172.16.40.12:8006 |
| 3  | 220-229 | 17-18 | 1349 | 172.16.40.14-172.16.40.15 | https://172.16.40.14:8006 |
| 4  | 230-239 | 19-20 | 1350 | 172.16.40.16-172.16.40.17 | https://172.16.40.16:8006 |
| 5  | 240-249 | 21-22 | 1351 | 172.16.40.18-172.16.40.19 | https://172.16.40.18:8006 |
| 6  | 250-259 | 23-24 | 1352 | 172.16.40.20-172.16.40.21 | https://172.16.40.20:8006 |
| 7  | 260-269 | 25-26 | 1353 | 172.16.40.22-172.16.40.23 | https://172.16.40.22:8006 |
| 8  | 270-279 | 27-28 | 1354 | 172.16.40.24-172.16.40.25 | https://172.16.40.24:8006 |
| 9  | 280-289 | 29-30 | 1355 | 172.16.40.26-172.16.40.27 | https://172.16.40.26:8006 |
| 10 | 290-299 | 31-32 | 1356 | 172.16.40.28-172.16.40.29 | https://172.16.40.28:8006 |


- Both assigned switch ports **must be used** and properly bonded for LACP.
- The first IP in the WAN IP range is already assigned to Proxmox; the second is used for your router WAN interface.






### Step 3: Other Design Considerations


#### 1. Disaster Recovery


- Identify critical systems and services.
- Plan backup strategies (onsite/offsite, VM snapshots, file backups).
- Include failover mechanisms for AD, DNS, and core network services.
- Test restore procedures periodically.


#### 2. Firewall Rules (Least Privilege Principle)


- Follow the **principle of least privilege**: allow only traffic necessary for each system/service. This includes IP version, subnet ranges, protocols, and ports.
- **Key rule elements**:
  - **Source:** IP, subnet, VLAN, or alias.
  - **Destination:** IP, subnet, VLAN, or alias.
  - **Source Port:** Port(s) on the source machine (often `any`).
  - **Destination Port:** Port(s) on the destination system (e.g., `443`, `3306`).
  - **Protocol:** TCP, UDP, ICMP, or combination.
  - **Direction:** Inbound/outbound relative to the interface.
  - **Gateway (optional):** Policy-based routing.
  - **Schedule (optional):** Time-based access control.
- **Rule Ordering:**
  - Place **specific rules first** (e.g., service-to-service).
  - Place **general deny/catch-all rules last**.
- **Logging:** Enable logging for needed rules
- **Testing:** Use ping, traceroute, telnet, DNS queries, or application clients to confirm functionality.
- Consider creating **default-deny rules** for unclassified VLANs.


#### 3. Policies, Frameworks, and Laws


- Identify all relevant organizational policies and regulatory frameworks to enforce. Examples:
  - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
  - Password Policy
  - Access Control Policy
  - Data Retention and Disposal Policy
  - Remote Access Policy
  - GDPR or CCPA compliance (for European and US data handling)
  - Security Incident Response Plan
- These policies should guide firewall rules, user permissions, and network design.


#### 4. Devices â€“ Physical vs VM


- Users will require a mix of **physical workstations** and **VMs** (VDIs would also be suitable), depending on their role:
  - **Remote workers:** VM or VDI only
  - **Hybrid workers:** VM + physical workstation (assume half are onsite at a time)
  - **In-person workers:** Physical workstation only
- Document which devices are physical and which are virtual to assist with resource allocation.


**User List with Access Requirements:**


1. Emily Brown - CTO (Remote)
1. Albert Tay - Director of Fried Chicken (Hybrid)
1. Rachel Nguyen - HR Manager (In-person)
1. Alex Patel - IT Manager (Hybrid)
1. Karen Taylor - Customer Service Manager (In-person)
1. Jessica Rodriguez - Content Writer (In-person)
1. Ryan Lee - Graphic Designer (In-person)
1. Ben Anderson - Sales Representative (In-person)
1. Olivia Davis - Data Analyst (Remote)
1. Eric Nguyen - Network Administrator (Hybrid)


### Step 4: Hardware


- **Physical Workstations & Peripherals:**
  - Include monitors, keyboard/mouse, power, and network cables.
  - Ensure cables are properly terminated and tested.


- **VM Host Resources:**
  - Total RAM, CPU, and storage needed for all VMs.
  - Include overhead for snapshots, backups, and monitoring.
  - Adjust according to available server resources.


- **Networking Hardware:**
  - Switches, routers, access points, and patch cables.
  - Ensure proper VLAN configuration and separation of management traffic.
  - Include labeling for ports and cable runs for maintainability.


- **Backup and Recovery Hardware:**
  - On-site backup storage capacity and redundancy.
  - Plan for offsite backup if required for compliance or disaster recovery.


### Example Table


Hereâ€™s an example **VLAN, Services, and Firewall Rules Table** that demonstrates some of the information you will need to include. It organizes the network by VLAN, lists the services running in each, and gives example firewall rules. You can expand or adjust it as your design evolves.


| VLAN ID | VLAN Name           | IP Subnet     | Hosts/Services                   | Example Firewall Rules (Least Privilege)                                                                 |
