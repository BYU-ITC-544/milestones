# Milestone 5: Backup Systems

## Objective:

The purpose of backup and restore systems in an enterprise environment is to protect critical data and ensure business continuity in the event of data loss, system failures, disasters, or human error. Some key reasons for having such a system include:

1. Data protection and recovery
2. Business continuity
3. Compliance and legal requirements
4. Disaster recovery
5. Version control and historical data
6. Protection against ransomware and cyberattacks
7. Peace of mind and risk mitigation
8. System upgrades and migrations

Disaster recovery is of paramount importance for organizations of all sizes and types. It refers to the process and set of strategies and procedures put in place to recover and restore critical business operations after a significant disruptive event, such as a natural disaster, cyberattack, equipment failure, power outage, or any other event that can cause significant data loss or downtime. The importance of disaster recovery can be summarized as follows:

Disaster recovery is not just a reactive measure; it is a proactive strategy that enables organizations to prepare for unforeseen events, protect their assets, and ensure business continuity in the face of adversity. It is a crucial component of a comprehensive risk management and business continuity plan.

## Instructions:

It is recommended that you consult with a TA to ensure that your policy meets the requirements. Select one backup policy one of your team members wrote in homework 5 and implement it. For off-site backups, we have a small Synology device that can act as the 'off-site backup'. Ask the TA how you can access it and use it as a backup device. You can use it as either hot or cold backup storage.

## Step 1: Implementation

Designate one or more of your servers as the backup server that will contain the backups of all other VMs.

Some of the solutions you may want to consider are:

There are several open-source and free enterprise backup solutions available that can meet your backup needs. Here are a few popular options:

1. Bacula
2. Amanda
3. Duplicati
4. Veeam Backup & Replication Community Edition
5. Clonezilla
6. UrBackup
7. Bareos

These solutions vary in terms of features, scalability, and complexity, so it's important to evaluate them based on your specific requirements. Additionally, make sure to review the licensing terms and any potential limitations or restrictions that may apply.
