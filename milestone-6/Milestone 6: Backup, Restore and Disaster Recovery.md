# Milestone 6: Backup, Restore, and Disaster Recovery

## Objective:

The purpose of backup and restore systems in an enterprise environment is to protect critical data and ensure business continuity in the event of data loss, system failures, disasters, or human error. Some key reasons for having such a system include:

1. Data protection and recovery
2. Business continuity
3. Compliance and legal requirements
4. Disaster recovery
5. Version control and historical data
6. Protection against ransomware and cyberattacks
7. Peace of mind and risk mitigation
8. System upgrades and migrations

Disaster recovery is of paramount importance for organizations of all sizes and types. It refers to the process and set of strategies and procedures put in place to recover and restore critical business operations after a significant disruptive event, such as a natural disaster, cyberattack, equipment failure, power outage, or any other event that can cause significant data loss or downtime. The importance of disaster recovery can be summarized as follows:

Disaster recovery is not just a reactive measure; it is a proactive strategy that enables organizations to prepare for unforeseen events, protect their assets, and ensure business continuity in the face of adversity. It is a crucial component of a comprehensive risk management and business continuity plan.

## Instructions:

It is recommended that you consult with a TA to ensure that your policy meets the requirements.

### Step 1: Backup Policy

If you already have a backup policy that covers the points below, you can go to step 2. If not create or update it to cover all the points. Make sure to also justify your decisions/ reasoning

1. Data retention
2. Frequency of backups
3. Backup types
4. Storage media
5. Off-site backups
6. Encryption and security
